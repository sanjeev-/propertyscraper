coldwell banker: can scrape website fairly simply (server-side rendering) but has header checks and a captcha (bot detection)

homes.com : client side rendering. no obvious bot detection as of yet.

estately:

kw: on its face, this site seems very good.  not sure about bot detection.  also not sure how to do searches correctly. 

re/max: this one seems the simplest.  no need for selenium.  bs4 can search and parse the website.  one problem is finding a way to search easily (the urls, on first glance, are non obvious).

kw:  selenium can probably work for this, but still some issues.
