Tons of potential with this property: Keep it the way it is and move right in to this well-maintained property or renovate and update. Seller is a builder/contractor and has previous engineered floor plan to add additional square footage! Awesome, walkable location - minutes from hot-spots, restaurants, shopping, night-life, bars, etc. by foot or bicycle."
